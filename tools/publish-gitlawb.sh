# Publish Toshi to gitlawb — the decentralized git network its terminal (zero) comes from. GPL-3.0.
# ==================================================================================================
# Closes the open-source loop: Toshi rides zero (@gitlawb/zero) → Toshi's code lives on gitlawb too.
#
# ⚠️ Linux/macOS ONLY (the gl CLI has no Windows build — on Windows run this inside WSL: `wsl bash
#    tools/publish-gitlawb.sh`). Idempotent: re-running re-registers (safe) and force-updates the mirror.
#
# What it does, step by step (everything is the documented gitlawb.com/start flow):
#   1. puts the REAL linux gl on PATH (npm) — a stale Windows `gl` shim inherited into WSL silently
#      shadows it and breaks every push; and points git-remote-gitlawb at the public node (GITLAWB_NODE)
#   2. reuses the DID identity if present (Ed25519 keypair in ~/.gitlawb/identity.pem — BACK IT UP)
#   3. registers the DID with the public node — STOPS LOUDLY if the node demands an iCaptcha proof
#      (that human step can't be scripted; see the printed instructions)
#   4. mirrors THIS repo's public GitHub history into gitlawb://<your-did>/toshi via `gl mirror`
#      (no local gateway, no working-tree push — pulls the current master straight from GitHub)
